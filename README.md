The Restaurant Menu Management System (RMMS) is a
tool used by a restaurant that manages multiple menus and for ordering meals. The menus may be
used potentially at different venues and for different purposes like breakfast, lunch, dinner and take
away.
Each Menu has a unique ID, name and is associated with a particular venue and session time. For each
Restaurant menu, there are a number of available meals (menu items) available for ordering by guests.
This IT system, RMMS, will enable the manager to customise and save menus to the system as well as
view the stored list of menus. It will be possible to inspect details for each menu. The details will
include specifics of the menu as well as specific details regarding discounts that may apply to certain
meals. It will also be possible to categorise particular meals on each menu. The menu item
categorisation will determine the way that prices are calculated for display on the menu. Each menu
item will have a number, name, description and basic price associated with it, when the price for
display on the menu is calculated, this calculation may involve increasing the price with surcharges
(e.g. some special meals might have a surcharge due to the difficulty in sourcing their ingredients
locally); or decreasing the price due to a special discount.
There can be a number of possible types of menu items incorporated into your system. Example menu
item types are as follows:
1. A standard menu item will have the price calculated based exactly on the price entered into the
system.
2. A premium menu item can be created with a mechanism to indicate that it is to have a surcharge
added to the price. The surcharge will increase the price of the meal based on a constant
percentage mark up value specified by the manager;
3. It is possible to create a discount menu item meal to apply a discount to the given price;
4. Drinks menu item whose price will not have any surcharge and discounts.
Customer can order menu items from any one menu at one time. The RMMS will give discount to
customers according to their status. When customer place order, system will ask the status of
customer and discounts will be given according to following information.
1. Active customers are the one who visits restaurant at least once a week and will get 5% discount
on every order they made.
2. VIP customers are the one who have been visiting restaurant from more than one year and will
get 10% discount on all orders.
3. New Customers will not get any discounts.
Once an order is placed, RMMS will calculate the total of order and will issue invoice to customer.
